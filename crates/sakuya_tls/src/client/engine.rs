//! The client's handshake engine.
//!
//! [`ClientHandshake`] is the start state of a TLS 1.3 handshake for a QUIC
//! client connecting to a [`ServerTarget`], and implements
//! [`ClientHandshakeSteps`]. Like the server's engine, it owns the backend
//! and the client's capabilities, and each step receives the connection as
//! one access, lent on every poll, whose family has the
//! [`ClientHandshakeCapability`] (see [`engine`](crate::engine)): the
//! CRYPTO streams and a [`ClientTransport`], which gives the client's
//! transport parameters and checks the server's.
//!
//! The steps go:
//!
//! 1. [`write_client_hello`](ClientHandshakeSteps::write_client_hello)
//!    takes what to offer from the [`Offering`] and a ticket from the
//!    [`ClientTicketStore`], and writes the ClientHello at Initial, with the
//!    binder of the ticket; the hello names psk_dhe_ke with or without a
//!    ticket, for the server to send tickets. When it offers 0-RTT, it
//!    returns [`EarlyDataOffered`].
//! 2. [`read_server_hello`](ClientHandshakeSteps::read_server_hello) reads
//!    the ServerHello, or a HelloRetryRequest, after which it writes the
//!    second ClientHello and reads the ServerHello; it returns
//!    [`ServerHelloRead`].
//! 3. [`read_server_finished`](ClientHandshakeSteps::read_server_finished)
//!    moves both streams to Handshake, reads EncryptedExtensions and hands
//!    the server's transport parameters to the connection. It authenticates
//!    the server: with its certificate, verified by the
//!    [`CertificateVerifier`], and CertificateVerify, whose scheme must fit
//!    the certificate's key; or with the PSK the server accepted, keeping
//!    the identity the ticket recorded. It reads the server's Finished,
//!    writes an empty Certificate when the server asked for one, and writes
//!    its own Finished: the handshake is complete, and it returns
//!    [`ClientHandshakeCompleted`].
//! 4. [`read_tickets`](ClientHandshakeSteps::read_tickets) moves both
//!    streams to 1-RTT and keeps the tickets of the NewSessionTicket
//!    messages the server sends, for as long as it runs; a ticket that
//!    allows 0-RTT with a max_early_data_size other than 0xffffffff ends it
//!    with [`HandshakeError::ProtocolViolation`] (RFC 9001 §4.6.1).
//!
//! A failure ends the handshake with a [`HandshakeError`].
//!
//! Each step is also a `nitori_call` operation for every
//! [`ClientHandshakeSteps`], through [`write_client_hello_step`],
//! [`read_server_hello_step`], [`read_server_finished_step`] and
//! [`read_tickets_step`]: `#[call]` generates their operation structs
//! ([`WriteClientHelloStep`] and so on), each with a `new` constructor
//! taking the state, and their extension traits. `#[capability]` generates
//! `ClientTransportExt` and `ClientTransportViewExt`.

// The generated items have no documentation comments; the module
// documentation above describes them.
