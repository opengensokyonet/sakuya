//! The server's handshake engine.
//!
//! [`ServerHandshake`] is the start state of a TLS 1.3 handshake for a QUIC
//! server, from the ClientHello to the session tickets, and implements
//! [`ServerHandshakeSteps`]. It owns the backend and the server's
//! capabilities. Each step receives the connection as one access, lent on
//! every poll, whose family has the [`ServerHandshakeCapability`] (see
//! [`engine`](crate::engine)): the CRYPTO streams and a [`ServerTransport`],
//! whose [`ServerTransport::negotiate`] checks the client's transport
//! parameters and gives the server's own.
//!
//! The first ClientHello is read before the engine runs, by
//! [`read_first_client_hello`]: it needs only the limits on messages, not
//! the engine's state, so a server can read it, and decide what to do with
//! the connection, before it builds the engine. The steps go:
//!
//! 1. [`write_server_hello`](ServerHandshakeSteps::write_server_hello)
//!    takes the [`FirstClientHello`], opens its layers, selects the target
//!    and chooses the cipher suite and group; when the client sent no key
//!    share of that group, it writes a HelloRetryRequest and reads the
//!    second ClientHello, whose layers it opens with what opening the
//!    first gave. It opens an offered ticket and checks its binder,
//!    negotiates the transport parameters, and admits 0-RTT only when the
//!    handshake, the connection and the ticket policy all agree. It writes
//!    the ServerHello and returns [`ServerHelloWritten`], with the 0-RTT
//!    secret when it admitted 0-RTT.
//! 2. [`write_server_finished`](ServerHandshakeSteps::write_server_finished)
//!    moves both streams to Handshake, writes EncryptedExtensions and,
//!    unless it resumed, Certificate and CertificateVerify, whose signature
//!    may wait; it writes its Finished and returns the
//!    [`OneRttSendTrafficSecret`].
//! 3. [`read_client_finished`](ServerHandshakeSteps::read_client_finished)
//!    reads the client's Finished: the handshake is complete, and it returns
//!    [`ServerHandshakeCompleted`] with the exporter and the client's 1-RTT
//!    secret, which it held back until now (RFC 9001 §5.7).
//! 4. [`write_tickets`](ServerHandshakeSteps::write_tickets) moves both
//!    streams to 1-RTT, issues the session tickets of its ticket policy, and
//!    ends; it issues none when the client did not name psk_dhe_ke
//!    (RFC 9846 §4.3.9).
//!
//! A failure ends the handshake with a [`HandshakeError`]; a ClientHello
//! with a non-empty legacy_session_id ends it with
//! [`HandshakeError::ProtocolViolation`] (RFC 9001 §8.4), the first one
//! already in [`read_first_client_hello`].
//!
//! This version neither opens encrypted layers nor asks for a client
//! certificate: it takes layers whose confirmation and retry
//! configurations, and a peer authentication whose request, are
//! [`Infallible`], so those steps have no values to act on.
//!
//! [`read_first_client_hello`] is a `nitori_call` operation, and `#[call]`
//! generates [`ReadFirstClientHello`] and its extension trait.
//! `#[call]` cannot be written on the methods of a trait. Each step is also
//! a `nitori_call` operation for every [`ServerHandshakeSteps`], through
//! [`write_server_hello_step`], [`write_server_finished_step`],
//! [`read_client_finished_step`] and [`write_tickets_step`]: `#[call]`
//! generates their operation structs ([`WriteServerHelloStep`] and so on),
//! each with a `new` constructor taking the state, and their extension
//! traits. `#[capability]` generates `ServerTransportExt` and
//! `ServerTransportViewExt`.

// The generated items have no documentation comments; the module
// documentation above describes them.
