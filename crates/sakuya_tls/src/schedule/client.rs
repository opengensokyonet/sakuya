//! The two ways a server authenticates to a client.
//!
//! After the ServerHello, a server authenticates with a certificate or with
//! the PSK it accepted, never both (RFC 8446 §4.1.1). The client's chain
//! splits there: only the certificate branch verifies a CertificateVerify,
//! and both branches meet at [`Authenticated`], the only value that reads
//! the server's Finished, so a client cannot skip authentication.

// `add` of each step adds a message to the transcript and returns the same
// step by value; it is not addition.
